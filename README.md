# Arduino-based-bluetooth-controlled-robot
This is a short project in which a 2 wheeled robot's movement is controlled by bluetooth (Implemented in 2018). Additionally, a servo-motor based "arm" is also attached to the robot, with one DOF.

Please note: There are 2 .ino files here. There was a file in which both were combined into one single code, but that file got deleted. So combine these two codes 
and run the entire program. 

DCBluetooth.ino ==> for controlling the DC motor wheels
SERVOBluetooth.ino ==> for controlling the "Arm".


Tools used: 
1. Arduino UNO board
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
3. DC motors (Adafruit) for Arduino
4. SG-90 Servo Motors
5. Jumper wires and normal wires
6. Small breadboard
7. Robot 2-wheel Chassis
8. Arduino Coding Platform
