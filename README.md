# Arduino-based-bluetooth-controlled-robot
This is a short project in which a 2 wheeled robot's movement is controlled by bluetooth (Implemented in 2018). Additionally, a servo-motor based "arm" is also attached to the robot, with one DOF.

Please note: There are 2 .ino files here. There was a file in which both were combined into one single code, but that file got deleted. So combine these two codes 
and run the entire program. 

Also note: There is a soil sensor attacheed in the video Implementation-2. That was just used for adding something that looks like a claw at the end of the arm!
The soil sensor is not part of the code. 

Yet another note: Change the PIN numbers in the code according to your physical connections!! 

DCBluetooth.ino ==> for controlling the DC motor wheels
SERVOBluetooth.ino ==> for controlling the "Arm".


Tools used: 
1. Arduino UNO board
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
3. DC motors (Adafruit) for Arduino
4. SG-90 Servo Motors
5. Jumper wires and normal wires
6. Small breadboard
7. Robot 2-wheel Chassis
8. Arduino Coding Platform
9. 9V battery


Output result videos can be seen in the Implementation 1 and 2 videos. Hope you like it!
